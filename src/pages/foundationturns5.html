      <p><strong>The first open source framework to be responsive.</strong> The first to be semantic. The first to be mobile first. The first to be constructed with Sass. The first to have accessibility built in. Foundation is focused on the future, which has earned it the respect and trust of thousands of the world’s biggest companies who have chosen to build their brands on Foundation and millions of designers and developers around the world who use it daily. No other framework has done more to push the web forward, and it’s grown to be one of the most popular open source projects in history. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished over the last five years and our sights are  set firmly forward, to the future, to new possibilities, and to continued firsts.</p>

        <p>Front-end web development has never been a more exciting place to be. Browser technology is moving rapidly, advanced JavaScript frameworks are enabling more and more complex applications, and design has finally taken its seat as the driver of new product development. All of this creates an incredible landscape where Foundation is more important than ever.  We’re cleaning up the existing framework to work better for all use cases, and planning ahead to keep Foundation on the cutting edge of the web.</p>

        <p>In the immediate future, we’ll be releasing a patch release (6.2.4) on October 20 that fixes a large number of outstanding issues and continues to improve consistency between the flex grid and the traditional float grid.  Following that, the next release targeted for December 2nd will improve usability and options of tabs and accordions, especially on mobile and keyboard devices. There will also be a new component that has been long requested - cards - and a bevy of additional features.  Looking further into the future, we’re planning a bevy of improvements to keep Foundation on the forefront of web technology, making the next five years even more exciting than the last five.</p>

        <p>Developing HTML emails is finally catching up with modern web design. The email design community has been receiving one exciting update after another. With Gmail now supporting &lt;style&gt; tags and the folks at Outlook focusing on improving the HTML email experience for Outlook, things are looking up! We couldn’t be more excited for where Foundation for Emails is headed.</p>

        <p>So what’s next for Foundation for Emails? In the short term, we’ll be rolling out a series of bug fixes to tighten up the overall framework and make the new and improved Gmail as happy as a clam. As we move into November, we’ll be eying to incorporate a tree-based parser so that those still wanting to inline can have more flexibility. We’re also pumped about including support for custom Inky tags that work with any language. It’s been an exciting few years with Foundation for Emails and we can’t wait to improve and simplify the world of HTML email development even more.</p>
