      <p>Don't let tables break your responsive layout anymore. This simple JS/CSS combo will let your tables adapt to small device screens without everything going to hell. It works by taking the first column and "pinning" it to the left of the table, allowing you to scroll the other columns under it. You don't lose the likely key for each row, but you also don't have to break your nice responsive layout.</p>
