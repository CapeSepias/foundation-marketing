      <h4 class="page-intro"><strong>Investing in design can be intimidating for a technical team. </strong> We all know that design is one of the key differentiators in today’s products, but it feels vague, complicated, and hard to get right. Often it can seem like designers and engineers are speaking different languages and seeing completely different things. We get it - we built Foundation to create a common language between design and development, and bridge that gap. With Foundation 6, a robust ecosystem of community integrations, and the new Foundation Building Blocks, it’s easier than ever to bridge the gap between your development team and your designers. We’ve put together a great resource to help you through it - download our free e-book to get your guide to leveraging the power of design for your business.
