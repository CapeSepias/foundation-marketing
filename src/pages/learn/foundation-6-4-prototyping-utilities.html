      <p class="page-intro">While in early stage development it's extremely valuable to get ideas and interactions up and shared with stakeholders for scrutiny. This is where rapid prototyping comes in. Get the idea out, get feedback, iterate, repeat. Foundation's Prototyping Utilities help you build coded prototypes from scratch ultra-fast. From positioning to visual styles, there are a range of utilities to choose from. Every Utility has a mixin, so you can use your own custom classes or swap classes for mixins in production for cleaner markup.</p>
