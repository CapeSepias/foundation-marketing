      <p>Your Foundation profile is where everyone sees how awesome you are. So what are points and why the heck should you care about them? Because they let everyone know that you're a badass designer and/or developer and a good person to boot. To get points, you need to be active on the forum helping out the newbies and taking on challenges with the seasoned vets. Points reflect your commitment to your craft, and can open up some awesome doors for you.</p>

      <p>You can also check up on all your communications right here and see who took notice of your comments and posts.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="medium-10 medium-centered columns">

      <h4>Provide answers and insights</h4>
      <p>Jumping into answer or share your experiences on other people's posts will get you noticed and people will be more likely to reciprocate. It’s fun and a great way to learn new things!</p>

      <h4>Quickly get answers by searching first</h4>
      <p>It’s likely your question has been asked before. Search first to save time. Jump into existing conversations. Collaborate!</p>

      <h4>Be detailed when posting a question</h4>
      <p>Explaining your question in detail is helpful. Adding the code you are working with, a link to the site, a demo on CodePen, or screenshots can really help the community assist you. Add your code to one of the codepens below, fork it, and share the link.</p>

      <ul class="no-bullet">
        <li><a href="https://codepen.io/rafibomb/pen/zByyZm">Foundation 5</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://codepen.io/rafibomb/pen/kXzzVJ">Foundation 6 w MotionUI</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Foundation is a community, as well as a Framework</h4>
      <p>Helping each other is what our community is all about. It’s ok to not have all the answers. Sometimes we can lead people to the right answer by asking questions. By getting in there and helping out, more people will help you.</p>
