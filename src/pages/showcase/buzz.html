        <p class="lead">Our friends at Smashing Magazine have written this easy tutorial for creating a "Star Wars" themed web app with Foundation for Apps.</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Foundation for Apps is a new single-page app framework from ZURB that is closely related to Foundation 5 (also known as Foundation for Sites, a widely used front-end framework). It’s built around AngularJS and a flexbox grid framework. It’s intended to make creating a web app very quick and simple, enabling us to quickly start writing the code that’s unique to our application, rather than boilerplate.</p>

I monitor the email grid system's evolution with bated breath."</h4>

The amount of thought and refinement that goes into developing a good product from a good product idea is enormous. I've found ZURB's approaches to be inspiring. It makes me want to make things--great things--award-winning things. That sort of inspiration is what helped me work up the courage to move from Washington DC to the Bay Area in pursuit of my techie dreams. That inspiration is priceless to me. Hence my gratefulness for having the change to just say, "Hell, yeah, ZURB! Keep on ZURBbing."</h4>
