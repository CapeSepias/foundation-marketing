        <p>A front-end <a href="https://zurb.com/word/framework">Framework</a> is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript containing design patterns that you can build upon. They keep you from wasting time rewriting boring, boilerplate code over and over again. In addition to saving time, they actually help you write better code. Sites built on Foundation work great on multiple devices including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mobile phones because it is a <a href="https://zurb.com/word/responsive-web-design">responsive</a> framework that uses CSS media queries and a <a href="https://zurb.com/word/mobile-first">mobile-first approach</a>. Designers can create unique designs for a variety of screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience no matter the device.</p>

        <p>Foundation includes tools and resources like a robust and flexible responsive grid with tons of handy options, modals, typography, navigation components, and form elements that designers can quickly plug in to their products. Foundation is also modular, meaning you can use as little or as much of it as you need.</p>

        <p>Because developers all around the world (including us here at ZURB) are using Foundation daily, lots of iteration is made on the code and bugs are constantly being squashed. Think of it as a collection of shared wisdom, with an entire global community figuring out best practices. Easy-to-use, quick to learn and full of powerful tools, Foundation is the most advanced front-end framework available.</p>

        <h3 class="small-text-center">Built for Four Corners</h3>
        <p class="small-text-center">When we released Foundation in 2011, we wanted to create a way for people to easily build responsive sites, and that continues to be our driving motivation. At ZURB, we almost exclusively create responsive sites for ourselves, and our clients, and Foundation plays a huge role in that. We use it every day, and we know it works.</p>

        <h3 class="small-text-center">Built on Sass</h3>
        <p class="small-text-center">We decided that Foundation would be built on Sass (Scss, technically) a little over a year ago and we’ve never looked back. Not only is Sass in constant development, but through Sass you get the power of semantic code, faster styling, and tons of awesome programmatic features.</p>

         <p>Foundation isn't solely for individual designers, but for entire teams. And its benefits are proven every day here at ZURB. We battle test the framework daily on every client or internal project that we do, from marketing sites to web/mobile applications. And if it helps us do what we do, then it can certainly help other companies, designers and developers as well. That makes Foundation the perfect foundation for any business's product.

          <p>Foundation had its secret origins in the ZURB style guide back in 2008, which we used on every client project. Eventually, we decided we needed a framework that allowed us to prototype rapidly. We took our global CSS, jQuery plugins, common elements and best practices, and whipped them into what became Foundation, which we first released to the public in 2011. We decided to open-source Foundation because we knew it would help push responsive design forward, but mostly to help people design better and faster.</p>

          <p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>, we predicted the future. We saw that mobile was becoming more popular — and more important. We knew we had to have something more functional and fluid to work on different screens, different orientations. That the framework had to be responsive was a no-brainer. And we were the first open-source framework to be responsive. We were also the first semantic framework and the first to be Mobile First. When Foundation 5 came out, we were also be the first to include Sass partials.</p>

          <p>Throught the years, Foundation has grown a dedicated community of designers and developers. Along with that, our mascot, <a href="https://zurb.com/article/1224/11-things-you-didn-t-know-about-foundatio">the Yeti</a> has also changed. We continue to explore uncharted territories to ensure Foundation remains the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world … and beyond!</p>
