            <h4 class="subheader">Drop It Into A Project</h4>
             <p>Hip-hop artist Honors English wanted a <a href="http://thehonorssociety.com">brand-spanking new website</a>, he turned to the folks at They Integrated. Ryan Blaind, at They Integrated, was familiar with ZURB but hadn't known much about Foundation until he ran across a tweet that mentioned the responsive framework. That's when Ryan checked Foundation out, finding it looked easy enough to drop into a project.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"In the end, it came out pretty awesome."</blockquote>
            
            <h4>Didn't Have to Think About It </h4>
            <p>Ryan did some customization in CSS, mostly changing the default colors. Although, he ran into a small problem getting the Orbit slider to work in Firefox. Ryan used a quick javascript fix to resolve the issue. He also made some changes to the slider to create a new version with a transparent background.</p>

           <p>In the end, Ryan was able to use a majority of Foundation's forms and buttons. He even went back and used Reveal for a sign-up model. Everything was so easy that, as Ryan put it:</p>
            
         <blockquote>"You don't have to think about it."</blockquote>
            
         <h4>Used Foundation Again For Another Project</h4>
         <p>Ryan had found Foundation so easy to use that he turned to it when it came time to design an appetizing new <a href="http://burgerrevolution.ca/">website for a popular burger joint</a> in a town east of Toronto. He said everything came together quickly since he didn't have to write the markup completely from scratch. </p>
        
         <p>The diversity of Ryan's clients is a clear representation of the versatility offered with Foundation. With so many features, it's easy to build sites that so perfectly mesh with the story that a business, product, service or even an artist is trying to evoke.</p>        </div>
